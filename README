    Typical crystal resonator:
	32.768 kHz:  12.5pF  ECS Inc. ECS-.327-12.5-39-TR
		https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ecs-inc/ECS-327-12-5-39-TR
		https://ecsxtal.com/store/pdf/ECX_39.pdf
		Load cap = 12.5pF typ.
		Shunt cap = 1.33pF typ.
		Drive level = 1uW max.
		ESR = 70kohm max.

    See: https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/modeling-of-quartz-crystal.html

    R1 = ESR
    C0 = Cshunt
    C1 = (Cshunt * Cload) / (Cshunt + Cload)  <--- This is questionable
    L1 = 1 / ((2*pi*fres)^2 * C1)
    CL1 = CL2 = Cload / 2

    For the 32.768kHz resonator:
    
    R1 = 70k ohms
    C0 = 1.33 pF
    C1 = 1.2021 pF
    L1 = 19.625 H
    CL1 = CL2 = 6.25 pF

    However, better answer obtained simply by finding a different part number in
    the Digi-Key catalog with a motional inductance and capacitance given as
    parameters.

    R1 = 50k ohms
    C0 = 1.1 pF
    C1 = 3.5 fF
    L1 = 6740 H
    CL1 = CL2 = 12.5 pF

Pierce XO:
	Design guide says that for 32kHz crystals, the feedback resistor
	should be 10-15 MOhms.

Implementation uses a three-stage inverter with current-starved stages.  The
current is limited to the nanoamps range to make the whole system < 1uA.
The first stage input and last stage output connect to the resonator and
have a sinusoidal waveform.  The inner two stages have high gain and
rail-to-rail operation.  The middle stage output is copied to a second
output buffer whose first stage is a level-shift-down followed by a
second stage.

To keep overall power low, the 2nd output stage is very small.  Any
implementation should buffer this close to the oscillator (or the last
stage could be increased in drive stength).

There is one enable input "ena" that is in the 1.8V digital domain and
enables the oscillator.  When disabled, all current channels are blocked
so power is in the picoamp range.

The other digital input is "boost" and greatly increases the amount of
current when both it and "ena" are turned on.  Use of "boost" should
decrease the startup time at the expense of current and should be used
only for short periods of time, if at all.
